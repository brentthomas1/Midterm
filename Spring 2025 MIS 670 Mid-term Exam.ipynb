    "2. Collect at least 100 attractions (around 2 pages, 50 on each page), less than 100 attractions, will get 10 points deducted.\n",
    "3. The dataset should include the following details: `{\"Attraction_name\":[], \"Rating\":[], \"Ticket_price\":[],\"Free_cancellation\":[], \"Attraction_page\":[]}`\n",

    "1. If you encounter a **captcha verification** prompting you to complete a puzzle to prove that you are not a robot, you can solve the puzzle directly on the **driver browser page.** (Use Selenium as a regualr browser). Completing one verification should allow you to access the page at least 10 times with the same IP address.\n",
    "2. If you find it challenging to locate an element, you can select the entire project section and then search for the element from the parent node.\n",
    "    - For example, the universal xpath for titles could be `/html/body/div[2]/div[1]/div/main/div[2]/div[2]/div/section/section[2]/section[4]/div/section/div/div[2]/section/div/div[2]/section/h3` for the example link (Tokyo, Japan)\n",
    "3. If the data does not load properly—for example, if you can't see 100 attractions—you can refresh the driver or close it and reopen the URL. Setting a longer waiting time may help the data load correctly.\n",
    "4. `zip()` truncates to the shortest list (meaning if some elements do not exist, it will cut the entire row), you can handle this explicitly by using `itertools.zip_longest()` (check online resources for how to use this new function). This allows you to fill missing values with None or a specific string."
